# OkeyGame
This code creates an #numbers arraylist and adds 106 times numbers that starts from 0 to 52.
Thats there are 2 times of a same number.

then creates an #players arraylist of lists and adds 4 #player lists to it.
It randomly assigns values from #numbers to #player lists. 
and removes the values that assigned to the lists.

then selects indicator randomly and adds 1 to indicator and finds the okey number

and the numbers in player lists are sorted according to the colours of them.
gets modulos of the numbers and finally they are sorted increasingly.
